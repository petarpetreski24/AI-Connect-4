# Project Title: Connect 4 Strategies using Expectimax and Minimax Algorithms

## Project Description:

## Introduction:
The "Analyzing Connect 4 Strategies using Expectimax and Minimax Algorithms" project is an exciting exploration of artificial intelligence (AI) applied to the classic game of Connect 4. This project is designed for a class in Artificial Intelligence, providing students with hands-on experience in implementing and comparing two AI algorithms, Expectimax and Minimax, for playing Connect 4. Additionally, the project involves the collection and analysis of game statistics to evaluate the performance of these algorithms.

## Project Objectives:

1. Implementation Expectimax and Minimax Algorithms: Implementing both Expectimax and Minimax algorithms to create intelligent agents that can play Connect 4. These agents will make decisions on their next moves based on different strategies, facilitating a direct comparison of their effectiveness.

2. Game Simulation: A Connect 4 game environment , allowing users to test their AI agents against each other and potentially against human players. This simulation will serve as the testing ground for the algorithms and provide a platform for evaluating their performance.

3. Data Collection: Running multiple game simulations with various configurations of the AI agents competing against each other. During these simulations, the project will record important statistics, such as the number of wins, losses, draws, and average game duration for each AI strategy.

4. Analysis and Comparison: The collected data wiisll be analyzed to determine the strengths and weaknesses of the Expectimax and Minimax algorithms in the context of Connect 4. This analysis will provide insights into which algorithm performs better and under what conditions.

5. Heuristic Functions: The opportunity to experiment with different heuristic functions and its weights used in the evaluation step of the algorithms. They can fine-tuned to observe the impact on AI performance and strategy.
